# Q.1 What is a Media Query in CSS, and what is its purpose?

Ans: A media query in CSS is a helpful tool for making websites look great on different devices, like phones, tablets, and computers. It works by checking the characteristics of the device, such as its screen size or orientation, and applying specific styles accordingly. With media queries,we can create layouts and designs that adjust and fit perfectly on screens of all sizes. It's like having different sets of instructions for different devices, ensuring that the website looks good and is easy to use, no matter how you're accessing it. Media queries are written using special code called "@media" followed by conditions, which tell the website how to adapt based on the device it's being viewed on. By using media queries, we can make sure that websites are responsive and user-friendly, providing a great experience for visitors on any device.
