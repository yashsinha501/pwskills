# Q.4 What are the major features introduced in ECMAScript 6?

1. let and const: The let and const keywords were introduced for block-scoped variable declarations. let allows variables to be block-scoped, while const allows the declaration of constants that cannot be reassigned.

2. Arrow Functions: Arrow functions provide a more concise syntax for writing function expressions. They have lexical this binding and don't create their own this value.

3. Classes: ES6 introduced class syntax for creating objects with a constructor and methods. It provides a more familiar and structured way of working with object-oriented programming in JavaScript.

4. Template Literals: Template literals allow for more expressive string interpolation and multiline strings. They are delimited by backticks (`) and can include placeholders for variable substitution.

5. Destructuring Assignment: Destructuring assignment allows you to extract values from arrays or objects into separate variables using a concise syntax. It simplifies working with complex data structures.

6. Default Parameters: ES6 introduced the ability to define default values for function parameters, making it easier to handle cases where arguments are not provided.

7. Rest and Spread Operators: The rest (...) and spread (...) operators allow for working with variable length argument lists and arrays more conveniently. The rest operator collects multiple arguments into an array, while the spread operator spreads an array into individual elements.

8. Modules: ES6 introduced a standardized module system for organizing and sharing JavaScript code. Modules allow for better encapsulation, reuse, and dependency management.

9. Promises: Promises were introduced as a built-in way to handle asynchronous operations. Promises simplify the handling of asynchronous code, making it easier to work with asynchronous tasks and avoid callback hell.
