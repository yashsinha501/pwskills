# Q.1 Whatâ€™s difference between Synchronous and Asynchronous?

# Synchronous:

Timing: In synchronous communication, events or tasks occur in a predetermined order and follow a specific timeline.
Waiting: Each step or action waits for the previous one to complete before proceeding.
Real-time: Synchronous communication happens in real-time, with the sender and receiver synchronized.
Blocking: In synchronous programming, an operation blocks the execution until it completes, potentially causing delays or freezes.
Examples: Phone conversations, real-time video conferences, traditional function calls in programming languages.

# Asynchronous:

Timing: In asynchronous communication, events or tasks are not time-dependent or synchronized.
Independence: Actions occur independently and at their own pace, without waiting for immediate responses or completion of previous actions.
Non-real-time: Asynchronous communication does not require immediate synchronization between sender and receiver.
Non-blocking: In asynchronous programming, operations do not block the execution. The program can continue with other tasks while waiting for the completion of asynchronous operations.
Examples: Emails, asynchronous messaging, callbacks in programming, asynchronous file uploads or downloads.
