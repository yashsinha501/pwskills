# Q.7 Whatâ€™s Grid & Flex and difference between them?

Flexbox and CSS Grid are two layout systems in CSS that offer different approaches to building flexible and responsive web layouts. Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout system that focuses on arranging elements along a single axis, either horizontally or vertically. It provides flexibility in resizing and positioning elements, allowing for dynamic content flow and alignment. Flexbox is particularly useful for creating responsive designs, such as navigation menus and card layouts.

On the other hand, CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system that enables precise control over both rows and columns in a grid structure. It allows for creating complex and grid-like layouts with explicit sizing, positioning, and alignment of grid items. CSS Grid is well-suited for designing multi-column layouts, grid-based designs, and advanced placement techniques like grid areas and named lines.
