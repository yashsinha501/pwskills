# Q.7 Whatâ€™s Async & Await Keyword in JavaScript

async: The async keyword is used to declare a function as asynchronous. It can be placed before a function declaration or function expression. When a function is marked as async, it means that it will always return a promise.

await: The await keyword can only be used inside an async function. It is used to pause the execution of the function until a promise is resolved or rejected. When encountering an await expression, the function waits for the promise to settle. It allows you to write asynchronous code that looks and behaves like synchronous code.
