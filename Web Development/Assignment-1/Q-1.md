# Q.1 <!DOCTYPE html> is it a tag of html? If not, what is it and why do we use it?

   Ans: <!DOCTYPE html> is not tag in html. It is a statement or declaration. It is a `Information` to a browser about what type of it is. Full Form of Doctype is Document Type. The <! DOCTYPE> tag tells the browser which version of HTML you're using. 
     BY using this we can know,  which version and which type we used in our html and also browser can easily understand about what version of HTML the page is written in.
