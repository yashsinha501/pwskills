# Q.8 What is the difference between <figure> tag and <img> tag?

The <figure> tag is used to encapsulate and group together related content, typically an image along with its caption or explanatory text.
Example:
<figure>
    <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of the image">
    <figcaption>Caption or description for the image</figcaption>
</figure>

The <img> tag is specifically used to embed and display an image on a webpage. It is a void element and does not have a closing tag.
Example: 
 <img src="image.png"/>
