# Q.9 Whats fetch in JavaScript?


In JavaScript, fetch() is a built-in function that allows you to make asynchronous network requests and retrieve resources from a specified URL. It is commonly used to send HTTP requests and handle responses in web applications.
The fetch() function returns a promise that resolves to the response of the request. The response can then be processed or used to extract data.
