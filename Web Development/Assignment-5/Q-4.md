# Q.4 What are the ways we have to handle Async Code in JS?

There are several techniques available to handle asynchronous code:

1. Callbacks: Callbacks are functions passed as arguments to other functions, which are executed once an asynchronous operation completes. They allow you to specify the behavior that should occur after the operation finishes. However, managing callbacks can become complex and lead to callback hell, where multiple nested callbacks make code difficult to read and maintain.

2.Promises: Promises provide a more structured approach to handling asynchronous operations. A promise represents the result of an asynchronous operation that may be pending, fulfilled, or rejected. With promises, you can use the .then() and .catch() methods to handle success and error cases respectively. Promises simplify asynchronous code by allowing you to chain operations and handle errors more effectively.

3. Async/await: Async/await is a modern syntax introduced in ES2017 that simplifies writing asynchronous code. It allows you to write asynchronous functions in a more synchronous style, making the code easier to read and understand. The async keyword is used to declare an asynchronous function, and the await keyword is used to pause the function's execution until a promise is resolved. Async/await builds on top of promises and provides a more intuitive way to work with asynchronous code.
