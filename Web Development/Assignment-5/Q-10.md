# Q.10 How do you define an asynchronous function in JavaScript using async/await?

An asynchronous function in JavaScript is defined using the async keyword. This keyword signifies that the function will execute asynchronous operations. Within an asynchronous function, the await keyword is used to pause the execution of the function until a promise is resolved or rejected. By using await, the function waits for the promise to settle and returns the resolved value. If the promise is rejected, an error is thrown, which can be caught and handled using a try-catch block. The use of async/await allows for a more readable and sequential coding style for asynchronous tasks, making the code structure resemble synchronous code. It simplifies the handling of asynchronous operations and avoids callback nesting or excessive use of then() method chaining.
