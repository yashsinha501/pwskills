# Q.5 What are Callbacks & Explain Callback Hell ?

# Callback:
Callbacks are functions that are passed as arguments to other functions and are executed at a later time or when a certain event occurs. They are a fundamental concept in JavaScript and are commonly used in asynchronous programming to handle the results of asynchronous operations.

In simple terms, a callback is a way to specify what should happen after a certain operation or event has completed. It allows you to provide a function that will be invoked when a particular task is finished, such as fetching data from a server, reading a file, or receiving a user input.

# Callback Hell:

Callback Hell, also known as "pyramid of doom" or "callback spaghetti," refers to a situation where multiple asynchronous operations are nested within each other as callbacks. It typically occurs when dealing with complex asynchronous code that depends on the results of previous operations. This nesting can quickly lead to deeply indented and hard-to-read code. It becomes difficult to understand the flow of the program and handle errors effectively.
Callback Hell makes code maintenance, debugging, and understanding more challenging. To mitigate this issue, there are alternative approaches available, such as using Promises, async/await, or libraries like async.js or Bluebird, which provide better control flow management and help avoid the excessive nesting of callbacks.
