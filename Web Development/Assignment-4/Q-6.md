# Q.6  What is template literals in ES6 and how do you use them?

It is an enhanced way to work with strings in JavaScript. They allow for more expressive string interpolation and multiline strings. Template literals are delimited by backticks (`) instead of single or double quotes.

String Interpolation: You can insert expressions or variables directly into the string using ${} within the template literal. The expressions inside ${} will be evaluated and their values will be interpolated into the string.
const name = 'Rishabh';
const age = 18;
console.log(`My name is ${name} and I'm ${age} years old.`);
 // Output: My name is Rishabh and I'm 18 years old.
