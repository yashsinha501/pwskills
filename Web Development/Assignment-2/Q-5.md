# Q.5 How is Border-box different from Content Box?

Content Box: The default box-sizing property in CSS is "content-box". When an element has the "content-box" box-sizing, the specified width and height of the element only include the content area and do not take into account the padding, border, or margin.

Border-box: The "border-box" box-sizing property alters the default box model behavior. When an element has the "border-box" box-sizing, the specified width and height include the content area, padding, and border. The margin is still added to the overall size of the element.
