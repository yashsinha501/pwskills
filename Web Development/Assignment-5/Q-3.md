# Q.3 Explain SetTimeOut and setInterval.

# setTimeout:
setTimeout is a function that allows you to execute a piece of code or a function after a specified delay (in milliseconds). It takes two arguments: a callback function or code to be executed, and the delay duration. Once the specified delay has elapsed, the callback function is invoked.

# setInterval:
setInterval is a function that repeatedly executes a piece of code or a function at a specific interval. It takes two arguments: a callback function or code to be executed, and the interval duration (in milliseconds). The callback function will be invoked repeatedly at the specified interval until it is cleared.
