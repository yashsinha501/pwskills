# Q.5 What is the difference between let and const in ES6?

 1.  Variables declared with let are mutable, which means their values can be reassigned. On the other hand, variables declared with const are immutable, and their values cannot be changed once assigned. However, it's important to note that the immutability of const applies only to the variable binding itself, not to the value it references. If the value is an object or an array, its properties or elements can still be modified.

 2. Both let and const are block-scoped, which means they are only accessible within the block they are declared in (e.g., inside a loop, if statement, or function). They are not accessible outside of the block. This is in contrast to variables declared with var, which have function-level or global scope.

 3. Both let and const are hoisted to the top of their respective blocks during the compilation phase, similar to var. However, variables declared with let and const remain in the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) until their declaration statement is encountered. Accessing them before their declaration will result in a ReferenceError.
