# Q.4 Whats difference between Inline, Inline Block and block ?

Inline elements: Flow with text, don't create line breaks, and occupy only the necessary space for their content.

Inline-block elements: Flow with text, can have specific dimensions and vertical alignment, and respect box model properties like margins and padding.

Block elements: Start on a new line, occupy the full width available, and can have specific dimensions, margins, padding, and vertical alignment.
