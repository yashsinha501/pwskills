# Q.1 Whatâ€™s Box Model in CSS ? 

The box model in CSS is a fundamental concept that describes how elements are structured and rendered on a web page. It consists of four parts: content, padding, border, and margin.

1. Content: It is the actual area where the element's content, such as text or images, is displayed. The content area's size is defined by the width and height properties.

2. Padding: It is the space between the content and the element's border. Padding adds extra space within the element, providing separation between the content and the border.

3. Border: It is a line that surrounds the padding and content of an element. Borders can have different styles, colors, and thicknesses.

4. Margin: It is the space outside the element's border. Margins create space between elements and help control the layout of the page.
