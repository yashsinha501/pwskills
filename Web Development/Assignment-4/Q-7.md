# Q.7 Whatâ€™s difference between map & forEach?

Both map() and forEach() are array methods in JavaScript used for iterating over elements. However, they have some differences in their behavior and return values:


map():
Returns a new array with the results of the provided function applied to each element.
Used for transforming an array into a new array.
Returns an array.


forEach():
Executes a callback function for each element in the array.
Used for executing a function on each element of an array without returning anything.
Does not return anything (returns undefined).
