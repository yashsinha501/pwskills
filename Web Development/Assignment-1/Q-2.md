# Q.2 Explain Semantic tags in html? And why do we need it?

    Ans: Semantic tags are introduced in HTML5. A semantic tag clearly conveys its meaning to both browsers and developers. So by using this we can easily understand why we use this tag and what will be written inside it.

    We use it for many reasons;
    1. Semantic tags enhance accessibility for users with disabilities. These tags provide additional information to assistive technologies, such as screen readers, in understanding and presenting content to visually impaired individuals.

    2. Semantic tags contribute to better organization and readability of web pages. By using tags like <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <article>, and <footer>, you structure your content in a logical and hierarchical manner, making it easier for both users and search engines to navigate and comprehend the information.

    3. Semantic tags improve the overall user experience. When web pages are well-structured with semantic tags, it enhances the user's ability to quickly scan and understand the content, improving usability and reducing bounce rates.

    4. Semantic tags also play a role in future-proofing your website. As new web technologies and standards emerge, semantic markup helps ensure that your content remains compatible and adaptable, making it easier to update and maintain your website over time.
