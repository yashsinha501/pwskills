# Q-2.  Explain Temporal Dead Zone?

`Temporal Dead Zone` is the period of time during which the let and const declarations cannot be accessed. Temporal Dead Zone starts when the code execution enters the block which contains the let or const declaration and continues until the declaration has executed.

Example: 
console.log(x); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'x' before initialization
let x = 10;

Variable is in the `Temporal Dead Zone` until the line let x = 10 is executed.
