# Q.6 What are Promises & Explain Some Three Method of Promise

Promises in JavaScript are objects used to handle asynchronous operations and represent the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous task. They provide a way to write asynchronous code that is more readable and easier to manage.

A promise can be in one of three states:

Pending: The initial state of a promise. It is neither fulfilled nor rejected.

Fulfilled: The promise has been resolved successfully with a value. This state is commonly referred to as "resolved."

Rejected: The promise encountered an error or was rejected with a reason.

# Promises have three important methods for working with asynchronous operations:

1. then(): The then() method is used to handle the successful resolution of a promise. It takes two optional callback functions as parameters: onFulfilled and onRejected. The onFulfilled callback is executed when the promise is fulfilled, and it receives the resolved value as an argument. The onRejected callback is executed when the promise is rejected, and it receives the reason for rejection as an argument.

2. catch(): The catch() method is used to handle the rejection of a promise. It takes a single callback function as a parameter, which is executed when the promise is rejected. It is equivalent to calling .then(undefined, onRejected).


3. finally(): The finally() method allows you to specify a callback function to be executed when the promise is settled, regardless of whether it was fulfilled or rejected. This method is commonly used for performing cleanup tasks or finalizing operations.
