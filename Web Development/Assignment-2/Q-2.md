# Q.2 What are the Different Types of Selectors in CSS & what are the advantages of them?

In CSS, there are various types of selectors that allow you to target specific elements in an HTML document. Each type of selector has its own advantages and use cases. Here are some commonly used selectors:

1. Type Selectors: Target elements based on their tag names. For example, p targets all <p> elements.

2. Class Selectors: Target elements based on the value of their "class" attribute. Denoted by a dot (.), e.g., .container.

3. ID Selectors: Target a specific element based on the value of its "id" attribute. Denoted by a hash (#), e.g., #header.

4. Attribute Selectors: Target elements based on the presence or value of their attributes. For example, [type="submit"] targets elements with "type" attribute set to "submit".

5. Descendant Selectors: Target elements that are descendants of another element. Specified by a space between two selectors, e.g., div p.

6. Pseudo-classes and Pseudo-elements: Target specific states or parts of elements. Pseudo-classes start with a colon (:) followed by a keyword, e.g., :hover. Pseudo-elements, denoted by double colons (::), target specific parts of elements, e.g., ::before.
