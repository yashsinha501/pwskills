# Q.3 Difference between var & let?

In javascript I feel var and let are same, but it is not truth. Both are differece here are the difference between var and let,

1. var have global socpe we can access it anywhere in our code it have no limits .
   but let have block leval scope we cannot access it out of the block.

2. We can redeclare varible with the same name when we use var. But when we use let that time we cannot redeclare the variable if we'll try to do it then it throw me error.

3. Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their scope and can be accessed before their declaration. However, they will have the value undefined until their assignment is reached. Variables declared with let are also hoisted, but they remain in the Temporal Dead Zone until their declaration is encountered.

4. When using var in a loop, a single variable is shared across all iterations, which can lead to unexpected behavior. This is commonly known as "var hoisting in loops." On the other hand, using let in a loop creates a new variable for each iteration
Example:
// Using var in a loop
for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  setTimeout(function() {
    console.log(i); // Outputs 5 for each iteration
  }, 1000);
}

// Using let in a loop
for (let j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
  setTimeout(function() {
    console.log(j); // Outputs 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 for each iteration
  }, 1000);
}
