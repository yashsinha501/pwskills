# Q.9 Whatâ€™s the difference between html tag and attribute and give example of some global attributes?

HTML Tags:
HTML tags are used to define and structure the elements of an HTML document. They enclose content and indicate the type or purpose of that content. Tags are represented by angle brackets < > and are usually written in pairs, with an opening tag and a closing tag. The opening tag precedes the content, and the closing tag follows it. For example:
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

HTML Attributes:
HTML attributes provide additional information or instructions for an HTML element. They are placed within the opening tag of an HTML element and modify the behavior or appearance of that element. Attributes consist of a name-value pair, where the name specifies the attribute, and the value provides the specific information. For example:
<a href="/Q-4.html">This is Question-4 Link.</a>


# Example of Global Attributes:
1. Class:  We can use one or more classes for target the elemant. By using this class we can change the style and also target the JavaScript.

2. Id: It is unique identifer for accessing the elemants.

3. Style: We can use this tag anywhere for styling the elemant.

4. Data-*:  We use this for creating our custom attributes.
