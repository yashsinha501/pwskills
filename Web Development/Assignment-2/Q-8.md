# Q.8 Difference between absolute and relative and sticky and fixed position explain with example.

1. Absolute Positioning: When an element is positioned absolutely, it is removed from the normal flow of the document and positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor or the document itself. This means that the element's position is specified using the top, bottom, left, and right properties. Absolute positioned elements are independent of other elements and can overlap them if their positions coincide. For example, you can position an image within a container div using absolute positioning to achieve a specific layout.
Example:
<style>
  .container {
    position: relative;
    height: 200px;
    width: 200px;
    background-color: lightgray;
  }

  .absolute-box {
    position: absolute;
    top: 50px;
    left: 50px;
    height: 100px;
    width: 100px;
    background-color: red;
  }
</style>

<div class="container">
  <div class="absolute-box"></div>
</div>



2. Relative Positioning: Relative positioning moves an element from its normal position within the document flow. However, unlike absolute positioning, it does not remove the element from the flow. The element retains its space in the document, and other elements are not affected by its positioning. Relative positioning is often used in combination with absolute positioning to fine-tune the positioning of elements within a layout.
Example:
<style>
  .relative-box {
    position: relative;
    top: 20px;
    left: 20px;
    height: 100px;
    width: 100px;
    background-color: blue;
  }
</style>

<div class="relative-box"></div>


3. Sticky Positioning: Sticky positioning is a hybrid of relative and fixed positioning. A sticky positioned element behaves as relatively positioned until it reaches a specified scroll threshold. Once the threshold is crossed, the element becomes fixed in its position relative to its nearest scrollable ancestor or the viewport. Sticky positioning is commonly used for creating elements that stick to the top or bottom of the viewport as the user scrolls, such as a navigation bar that remains visible.
Example:
<style>
  .sticky-box {
    position: sticky;
    top: 20px;
    height: 100px;
    width: 100px;
    background-color: green;
  }
</style>

<div class="sticky-box"></div>


4. Fixed Positioning: Fixed positioning removes an element from the normal flow and positions it relative to the viewport. The element remains fixed in its position, even when the page is scrolled. Fixed elements do not affect the layout of other elements on the page. This type of positioning is often used for creating elements like persistent headers or footers that stay in a fixed position regardless of scrolling.
Example:
<style>
  .fixed-element {
    position: fixed;
    top: 20px;
    right: 20px;
    height: 100px;
    width: 100px;
    background-color: lightgray;
  }
</style>

<div class="fixed-element"></div>
