# Q.1 Explain Hoisting in JavaScript.

Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving all declarations to the top of the current scope. This means that regardless of where variables and functions are declared in the code, they are effectively treated as if they were declared at the top of their scope.

Example:1 
console.log(x);    undefined
var x = 10;

Example:2
var x;
console.log(x);   // undefined
x = 10;
