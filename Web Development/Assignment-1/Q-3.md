# Q.3 Differentiate between HTML Tags and Elements?

   Ans: 
   `HTML tags` are used for building the blocks of html. HTML tags are start with angle brackets(<>) and come in pairs with opening and closing tags. The opening tag contains the name of the tag, and the closing tag has a forward slash (/) followed by the tag name.
   Example:  <p></p>,
             <a></a>,
             <div></div>,
             <header></header>,
             <section></section>  etc. 
  
  Here also p , a , div, header ,section all are example of tags.

   
   HTML Elemants are everything from the start tag to the end tag.
   Example:  <p>This is an paragraph.</p>

   Here in this example p tag and inside this which content is written it whole called a elemant.
