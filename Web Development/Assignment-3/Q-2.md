# Q.2 How do you define a media query in CSS?

Ans: To define a media query in CSS, we use the @media rule followed by conditions in parentheses. These conditions specify things like screen size, device type, or orientation. It's like telling the website, "Hey, if the screen is like this or the device is like that, do something special." For instance, we can say "If the screen width is less than 600 pixels, change the font size and layout." Inside the curly brackets, we write the CSS rules that should be applied when the conditions are met. It's a way to customize how the website looks and behaves on different devices. Media queries allow us to create responsive designs that adapt to various screen sizes. They help ensure that websites are user-friendly and visually appealing, regardless of whether you're using a smartphone, tablet, or desktop computer. By using media queries, we can make sure that important information is still visible on smaller screens, rearrange content to fit nicely, or even hide certain elements if they don't work well on a particular device. It's all about providing the best experience for the user, no matter what device they're using to access the website.
